/**
 * Merges incoming teams into the local collection.
 *
 * - ID collisions (team or player): remapped silently with new IDs.
 * - Team fingerprint matches: silently skipped and counted in `skipped` (not in `duplicateWarnings`).
 * - Player sig matches: reported in `duplicatePlayerWarnings` so the UI can prompt the user.
 * - Player `sig` fields are stripped from the output so they are not stored in the DB.
 * - When `options.allowDuplicatePlayers` is false (the default) and duplicate players are
 *   found, the import is blocked: `teams` is empty and `requiresDuplicateConfirmation` is
 *   true. Re-call with `{ allowDuplicatePlayers: true }` after the user confirms.
 *
 * **Legacy bundle limitation:** Players in legacy export bundles (pre-v2, no per-player `sig`
 * or stable `id`-based fingerprint) will have their sig recomputed using the bundle's player
 * `id` as the entropy source. If the ID was remapped between export and re-import, duplicate
 * detection will miss the match. This is intentional — legacy files may not have a stable `id`
 * that matches the stored fingerprint.
 *
 * **Legacy team fingerprint limitation:** Teams in legacy bundles lack a `team.fingerprint`
 * field, so the pre-scan falls back to `buildTeamFingerprint(team)` using the team's `id`.
 * A previously-imported legacy team will have been assigned a new `id` on import, so the
 * stored fingerprint will not match a re-import of the same legacy bundle with different IDs.
 * As a result, re-importing a legacy teams bundle may not be blocked by the pre-scan's
 * team-fingerprint check, and teams may be duplicated.
