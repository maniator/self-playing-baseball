 * Computes a seed-based integrity signature for a single player.
 * Covers only the player's immutable identity fields: name, role, and stats
 * (batting for hitters; pitching for pitchers), plus the per-player random seed
 * generated at creation time.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - `id` is intentionally excluded: IDs are remapped on import collision and must
 *     not affect duplicate detection — two players with identical stats and name but
 *     different DB IDs are the same person.
 *   - `position`, `handedness`, `jerseyNumber`, `pitchingRole` are intentionally excluded:
 *     these are editable after creation and must not invalidate a previously issued sig.
 *   - For pure hitters `pitching` is `undefined`. `JSON.stringify` omits `undefined` values
 *     consistently on both the export side and the re-import side, so the sig is
 *     deterministic across round-trips with no special normalisation needed.
 *   - `playerSeed ?? ""` fallback ensures legacy bundles without a seed still parse cleanly.
 *
 * The sig serves two purposes:
 *   1. Integrity checksum: detects accidental corruption or truncation of exported bundles
 *      on round-trip (file system, clipboard, network). This is NOT cryptographic — because
 *      the signing key is a hard-coded string, a maliciously crafted bundle can be
 *      re-hashed to produce a matching value.  Do not treat it as tamper-proof.
 *   2. Duplicate detection: a player whose sig matches one already in the DB is a likely
 *      duplicate even if imported to a different team or with a remapped ID.
