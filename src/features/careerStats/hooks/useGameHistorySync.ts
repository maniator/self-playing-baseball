/**
 * Hooks into the game's gameOver state and commits a completed game to RxDB
 * exactly once per game session.
 *
 * Idempotency is enforced at two levels:
 *   1. Session-level: an `inFlightRef` prevents concurrent commit attempts, and
 *      `committedRef` is set to true only after a successful commit. On transient
 *      failure the `retryCount` state is incremented (up to 3) so the effect
 *      re-fires without requiring a page reload.
 *   2. DB-level: `GameHistoryStore.commitCompletedGame` uses `gameInstanceId`
 *      as the CompletedGameRecord primary key — any concurrent insert of the same
 *      key is treated as "already committed", and missing stat rows are still written
 *      so a partial prior write never permanently loses stats.
 *
 * Loading an already-FINAL save must NOT trigger a new commit. The hook guards
 * against this by checking `wasAlreadyFinalOnLoad` — set when the save is
 * restored with `gameOver === true` from `stateSnapshot`.
