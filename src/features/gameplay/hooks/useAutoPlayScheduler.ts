/**
 * Speech-gated scheduler — runs while the game is in progress.
 * Waits for the current announcement to finish before pitching, so nothing
 * gets cut off. Adds a brief pause at half-inning transitions when muted.
 *
 * `gameOver` is included as an explicit parameter (and effect dependency) so
 * the scheduler restarts automatically when a new in-progress save is loaded
 * after a finished game — without it the timer chain would stay dead.
 *
 * With Game rendered as a proper route element, it unmounts when the user
 * navigates away from /game, so no off-route guard is needed.
