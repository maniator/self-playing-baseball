/**
 * AI manager strategy selection — mirrors the choices a human manager can make.
 *
 * Picks a batting strategy based on game context so the unmanaged team responds
 * intelligently instead of always using "balanced".
 *
 * Rules (evaluated in priority order):
 *  - Down 2+ late game (inning ≥ 7) → "power"   (swing for extra bases)
 *  - Down 1  late game (inning ≥ 7) → "aggressive" (pressure the bases)
 *  - 2 outs, close game (±2), inning ≥ 7 → "aggressive" (extend the inning)
 *  - Early game with runners in scoring position → "contact" (put ball in play)
 *  - Default → "balanced"
