/**
 * Public API for the pitch-simulation module.
 *
 * Implements the layered baseball pitch-resolution model:
 *   1. Swing decision   (computeSwingRate)
 *   2. Swing outcome    (resolveSwingOutcome): whiff | foul | contact
 *   3. Contact quality  (resolveContactQuality): weak → medium → hard
 *   4. Batted-ball type (resolveBattedBallType): pop_up | grounder | line_drive | fly ball
 *   5. Pitcher fatigue  (computeFatigueFactor): degrades effectiveness over batters faced
 *
 * All functions are pure (no side effects) and deterministic given the same inputs.
 * Random rolls are accepted as parameters so callers control the RNG sequence.
