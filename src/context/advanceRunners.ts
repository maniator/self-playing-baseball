/**
 * Advance runners using explicit, correct baseball rules.
 * Returns a fresh baseLayout tuple, run count, and optional runner IDs.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   HR     – all runners score, batter scores (grand-slam logic included)
 *   Triple – all runners score, batter to 3rd
 *   Double – runners on 2nd/3rd score; runner on 1st to 3rd; batter to 2nd
 *   Single – runner on 3rd scores; runner on 2nd to 3rd; runner on 1st to 2nd; batter to 1st
 *   Walk   – force advancement only (batter to 1st, each runner advances only if forced)
 *
 * Grounder / double-play scenarios are handled in hitBall.ts (handleGrounder):
 * ground outs, double plays, and fielder's-choice plays are resolved there before
 * advanceRunners is called, so this function only needs to handle clean hit advancement.
