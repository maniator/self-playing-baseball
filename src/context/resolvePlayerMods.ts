/**
 * ## Stat Wiring Inventory
 *
 * All stats listed here are editable in the CustomTeamEditor UI and persisted in the
 * `customTeams` RxDB collection (`TeamPlayer.batting` / `TeamPlayer.pitching`).
 * They are mapped into `playerOverrides` via `customTeamToPlayerOverrides` and cached
 * at game-start in `state.resolvedMods` (see `resolvePlayerMods` / `buildResolvedMods`).
 *
 * ### Batter stats
 * | Stat       | Stored | resolvedMods | Used in sim                                   |
 * |------------|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
 * | contact    | ✓      | contactMod   | hitBall: pop-out threshold (+/- hit chance)   |
 * | power      | ✓      | powerMod     | hitBall: HR bonus probability                 |
 * | speed      | ✓      | speedMod     | reducer: steal success % (via baseRunnerIds)  |
 *
 * ### Pitcher stats
 * | Stat       | Stored | resolvedMods  | Used in sim                                   |
 * |------------|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
 * | velocity   | ✓      | velocityMod   | hitBall: pop-out threshold; playerWait: strike ↑ |
 * | control    | ✓      | controlMod    | playerWait: strike probability ↑              |
 * | movement   | ✓      | movementMod   | hitBall: pop-out threshold (hit difficulty ↑) |
 *
 * ### Intentionally deferred stats (stored-only, not yet wired into sim)
 * - `handedness` (batter/pitcher): stored in TeamPlayer, not yet used to affect pitch outcomes.
 *   Planned for a future update when batter-vs-pitcher matchup splits are added.
 * - `pitchingRole` ("SP" | "RP" | "SP/RP"): stored in CustomTeamDoc, drives AI substitution logic only;
 *   does not yet affect pitch-by-pitch simulation.
 * - `staminaMod` (pitcher): editable in PlayerCustomizationPanel (via `PITCHER_MOD_FIELDS`) and
 *   stored in `PlayerCustomization`, but not part of `ResolvedPlayerMods` and not read by any
 *   simulation logic. Reserved for a future update to drive pitcher fatigue/usage modeling.
 *
 * ### Invariant: resolvedMods is a derived cache
 * `resolvedMods` is computed from `playerOverrides` exactly once at `setTeams` time
 * and is recomputed from `playerOverrides` during `backfillRestoredState` for old saves.
 * It must never be mutated independently of `playerOverrides`.
 * If player overrides ever become mutable mid-game (e.g. stat upgrades), `resolvedMods`
 * must be recomputed alongside any `playerOverrides` update.
