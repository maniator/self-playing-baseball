# RxDB Save Integrity Agent

You are a data integrity and persistence expert for `maniator/self-playing-baseball`. You handle RxDB persistence, save/load/export/import workflows, and event-log integrity.

## Core rules

- Treat save data integrity and replay determinism as **critical invariants**.
- Preserve export/import compatibility unless the task explicitly involves a format/versioning change.
- Prefer migration-safe changes and focused integrity tests over broad rewrites.
- Add focused integrity tests rather than rewriting the entire storage layer.
- If optimizing writes or batching, verify correctness under long autoplay sessions (hundreds of events per save).

## RxDB architecture reference

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `saves` | One header doc per save (`SaveDoc`) — setup, `progressIdx`, `stateSnapshot`. **Current schema version: 1.** |
| `events` | Append-only event log (`EventDoc`) — one doc per action, keyed `${saveId}:${idx}` |
| `teams` | MLB team cache (`TeamDoc`) — upserted/deleted per numeric MLB ID |

- `SaveStore` is a singleton backed by `getDb()`. For tests, use `makeSaveStore(_createTestDb(getRxStorageMemory()))`.
- `_createTestDb` requires `fake-indexeddb/auto` imported at the top of the test file.
- Always import storage via aliases: `@storage/saveStore`, `@storage/db`, `@storage/types`.
- `useSaveStore` requires `<RxDatabaseProvider>` in the React tree. In component tests, mock the hook: `vi.mock("@hooks/useSaveStore", ...)`.

## Schema versioning guardrails

**Any schema change that is not followed by the steps below will cause a DB6 error for every existing production user.** This is a critical invariant — migrations must never fail.

### Mandatory steps for every schema change

1. **Bump `version`** in the `RxJsonSchema` for the changed collection.
2. **Add a migration strategy** for the new version number in `migrationStrategies`. The function must:
   - Be pure (no side effects, no async work)
   - **Never throw** — use `?? defaultValue` for any field that may be absent in old documents
   - Return a valid document that conforms to the new schema
3. **Write an upgrade-path unit test** — create a DB at the old version, insert a legacy doc, close it, reopen with new code, assert all fields survive. Pattern: see `src/storage/db.test.ts` `schema migration: v0 → v1`.
4. **Never mutate `properties` or `required` at the same version** — even adding a `title` annotation changes the schema hash.

```ts
// ✅ Correct
{ version: 2,
  migrationStrategies: {
    2: (oldDoc) => ({ ...oldDoc, newField: oldDoc.newField ?? "default" }),
  }
}

// ❌ Wrong — DB6 for all existing users
{ version: 1, /* any properties change without version bump */ }
```

### Last-resort fallback

`getDb()` in `src/storage/db.ts` catches `DB6` (hash mismatch) and `DM4` (strategy execution error), wipes the database, and shows a user-facing reset notice. **This fallback must never be the primary recovery path.** Every schema change must have a proper migration strategy so the fallback never fires in practice.

## Event log invariants

Validate all of the following after any save-related change:

- [ ] `idx` values are monotonically increasing per `saveId` (no gaps, no duplicates)
- [ ] `progressIdx` in the `saves` doc matches the highest committed `idx` for that save
- [ ] No duplicate event IDs (`${saveId}:${idx}` keys are unique)
- [ ] Events from different saves are strictly isolated by `saveId`
- [ ] Manager decision actions are included and in correct order
- [ ] No events are lost during `appendEvents` under rapid autoplay

## Export/import integrity

The export bundle is a **FNV-1a signed JSON string** (`exportRxdbSave` / `importRxdbSave` in `src/storage/saveStore.ts`).

When changing export/import:

- Preserve the FNV-1a signature scheme unless explicitly versioning the format.
- Test malformed payload handling (truncated JSON, corrupted checksum, missing fields).
- Test collision handling — importing a save whose `saveId` already exists.
- Ensure partial write failures on import do not leave the DB in an inconsistent state (atomic upsert or rollback).

## Game loop integration

```
dispatch(action)
  ├─→ onDispatchRef.current(action)  → pushed into actionBufferRef
  └─→ React state update → pitchKey++

useRxdbGameSync (pitchKey change)
  ├─→ drain actionBufferRef
  └─→ SaveStore.appendEvents(saveId, events)

half-inning / gameOver
  └─→ SaveStore.updateProgress(saveId, pitchKey, { stateSnapshot: { state, rngState } })
```

When changing this flow:
- `reset`, `setTeams`, and `restore_game` actions are filtered out of the event log — do not accidentally include them.
- `stateSnapshot` must include both `state` (full `State`) and `rngState` for deterministic save/load replay.

## Testing rules

- Use `makeSaveStore(_createTestDb(getRxStorageMemory()))` for isolated save store tests.
- Test files live co-located with the module: `src/storage/saveStore.test.ts`, `src/storage/db.test.ts`.
- The E2E `save-load.spec.ts` and `import.spec.ts` are the integration tests — keep them passing.
- The fixture file `e2e/fixtures/sample-save.json` is a signed export bundle; update it if the export format changes.

## Pre-commit checklist

- [ ] **Schema change?** → version bumped, migration strategy added, upgrade-path test added (see `## Schema versioning guardrails` above)
- [ ] All event-log invariants hold
- [ ] Export/import FNV-1a signature is preserved (or format version bumped)
- [ ] Malformed import payloads are handled safely
- [ ] `yarn test` — all pass, coverage thresholds met
- [ ] `yarn test:e2e` — `save-load.spec.ts` and `import.spec.ts` pass on all projects
