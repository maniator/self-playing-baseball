## E2E Tests (`e2e/`)

Playwright E2E tests live in `e2e/` and are separate from the Vitest unit tests in `src/`.

### Projects

`playwright.config.ts` defines **7 projects**:

| Project | Browser | Viewport | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `determinism` | Desktop Chrome | 1280×800 | `determinism.spec.ts` only |
| `desktop` | Desktop Chrome | 1280×800 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `tablet` | WebKit (iPad gen 7) | 820×1180 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `iphone-15-pro-max` | WebKit (iPhone 15 Pro Max) | 430×739 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `iphone-15` | WebKit (iPhone 15) | 393×659 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `pixel-7` | Chromium (Pixel 7) | 412×839 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `pixel-5` | Chromium (Pixel 5) | 393×727 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |

The `determinism` project is intentionally isolated to desktop because it spawns two sequential fresh browser contexts per test — running it on all 6 device projects would multiply CI time by 6× for no additional coverage value (PRNG determinism is not viewport-dependent).

### Key design decisions

- **`vite preview` webServer** — E2E tests run against the production build (`dist/`), not `yarn dev`. This avoids the RxDB `RxDBDevModePlugin` dynamic import hanging the DB initialisation in headless Chromium.
- **Seed in URL before mount** — `initSeedFromUrl` is a one-shot init called before the React tree mounts. Seeds can also be set at runtime via the seed input field in the New Game dialog, which calls `reinitSeed(seedStr)` on submit and updates `?seed=` in the URL. E2E tests use `configureNewGame(page, { seed: "..." })` to fill the input field — no `/?seed=` URL navigation needed.
- **`data-log-index` on log entries** — each play-by-play `<Log>` element has `data-log-index={log.length - 1 - arrayIndex}` (0 = oldest event). `captureGameSignature` reads indices 0–4 to get a stable deterministic signature regardless of how many new entries autoplay has prepended.
- **Fresh context per determinism run** — `browser.newContext()` gives each game run its own IndexedDB, preventing the auto-save from the first run from restoring mid-game state in the second run and breaking seed reproducibility.

### Helper functions (`e2e/utils/helpers.ts`)

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `resetAppState(page)` | Navigate to `/` and wait for DB loading to finish |
| `startGameViaPlayBall(page, options?)` | Navigate to `/exhibition/new`, fill seed-input field (if provided), configure teams, click Play Ball |
| `configureNewGame(page, options?)` | Fill seed/team fields on `/exhibition/new` without submitting |
| `loadFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Navigate to `/` → Load Saved Game → import file fixture → auto-load restores state — self-contained, no prior `resetAppState` needed |
| `waitForLogLines(page, count, timeout?)` | Expand log if collapsed, poll until ≥ count entries (default 60 s timeout) |
| `captureGameSignature(page, minLines?, logTimeout?)` | Wait for entries, read `data-log-index` 0–4, return joined string |
| `openSavesModal(page)` | Click saves button, wait for modal |
| `saveCurrentGame(page)` | Open modal + click Save current game |
| `loadFirstSave(page)` | Open modal + click first Load button, wait for modal to close |
| `importSaveFromFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Open modal + set file input to fixture path (requires active game) |
| `assertFieldAndLogVisible(page)` | Assert field-view + scoreboard visible with non-zero bounding boxes |
| `disableAnimations(page)` | Inject CSS to zero all animation/transition durations (use before visual snapshots) |
| `computeTeamsSignature(page, payload)` | Evaluate `fnv1a(TEAMS_EXPORT_KEY + JSON.stringify(payload))` in the browser page context |
| `importTeamsFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Navigate to `/teams`, set `import-teams-file-input` to fixture path, wait for `import-teams-success` |

### Visual snapshots

Committed baseline PNGs live in `e2e/tests/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/` named `<screen>-<project>-linux.png`. These baselines are rendered inside the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-noble` container (the same image used by `playwright-e2e.yml`), so they must **always** be regenerated inside that same container to guarantee pixel-identical rendering.

**Never run `yarn test:e2e:update-snapshots` locally and commit the result.** Local OS fonts and rendering differ from the CI container, causing false visual-diff failures on every subsequent CI run.

When an intentional UI change requires new baselines, you have two options:

**Option 1 — Use the `e2e-test-runner` agent (preferred for Copilot sessions):** The agent runs `--update-snapshots` inside the same Docker container and commits the updated PNGs directly to the branch in the same session. No workflow wait required. See `.github/agents/e2e-test-runner.md` for the exact `docker run` commands.

**Option 2 — Use the `update-visual-snapshots` GitHub Actions workflow:**
- It fires **automatically** on every push to any non-master branch.
- For manual control: **Actions → "Update Visual Snapshots" → Run workflow → select your branch → Run workflow**.
- The workflow runs inside the same Playwright container as CI, regenerates all snapshot PNGs, and commits them back to your branch (without `[skip ci]`), so `playwright-e2e.yml` runs against the updated baselines on that commit.

Do **not** regenerate snapshots unless you are intentionally changing a visual.

### Workflow sequencing for snapshot changes

When you push a commit that changes the app or its tests, **two things happen**:
1. `update-visual-snapshots` fires (auto-trigger), regenerates PNGs in the CI container, and commits them back to the branch.
2. `playwright-e2e` fires against the *original* commit — this run may fail if the new test has no baseline yet.

Once `update-visual-snapshots` commits the new baselines, a *second* `playwright-e2e` run is triggered against that commit. That run uses the fresh baselines and should pass. The initial failure on the original commit is expected and self-correcting.

### CI

`.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml` — pure test runner; does **not** regenerate or commit snapshots:
1. `yarn build` — produces `dist/` for `vite preview`
2. `npx playwright test` — runs all projects headlessly (browser binaries pre-installed in the container)
3. Uploads `playwright-report/` + `test-results/` as artifacts on failure

`.github/workflows/update-visual-snapshots.yml` — snapshot regeneration workflow (auto-triggers on every push to non-master branches):
- Runs inside the **same** `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-noble` container as `playwright-e2e.yml`.
- **Auto-trigger:** every push to any non-master branch.
- **Manual trigger:** Actions → "Update Visual Snapshots" → Run workflow → select branch.
- Commits updated PNGs back to the branch; the commit triggers `playwright-e2e` to validate them.
- Concurrency group: cancels stale queued runs when a newer push arrives.

## Save Fixtures for E2E Testing

Pre-crafted save files in `e2e/fixtures/` let E2E tests jump straight into a specific game situation without waiting for autoplay to reach it. This slashes test time from 90–150 s (waiting for decisions or scoring plays) to under 15 s.

### When to use a fixture instead of `startGameViaPlayBall`

| Situation | Use fixture? |
|---|---|
| Need a manager decision panel visible immediately | ✅ `pending-decision.json` |
| Need specific pending decision (pinch hitter, shift, etc.) | ✅ craft a new fixture |
| Need RBI / stats already on the board | ✅ `mid-game-with-rbi.json` |
| Testing visual snapshot of a mid-game UI element | ✅ craft a fixture for that state |
| Testing correctness of the simulation (seed regression, determinism) | ❌ must use real `startGameViaPlayBall` |
| Testing the full game-completion flow (FINAL banner) | ❌ must use real autoplay |

### The `loadFixture` helper

```typescript
import { loadFixture } from "../utils/helpers";

await loadFixture(page, "pending-decision.json");
// Game is now active with the fixture's stateSnapshot applied.
// No startGameViaPlayBall, no waitForLogLines, no long timeouts needed.
```

`loadFixture` navigates to **Home → "Load Saved Game" → `/saves` page**, imports the file through the saves page file input, waits for the auto-load to restore state and navigate to `/game`, and confirms the scoreboard is visible — all in one call.

### Available fixtures

| File | State summary | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `sample-save.json` | Inning 2, Mets vs Yankees, no pending decision | Import smoke tests |
| `pending-decision.json` | Inning 4 bottom, defensive_shift pending, managerMode on | Manager decision panel UI, notification smoke |
| `pending-decision-pinch-hitter.json` | Inning 7 top, pinch_hitter pending + 2 candidates, default teams | Pinch-hitter dropdown visual snapshot |
| `pending-decision-pinch-hitter-teams.json` | Same as above but with custom teams + player sigs in the bundle | Signed custom-team fixture with player fingerprints |
| `mid-game-with-rbi.json` | Inning 5 top, 3-2 score, playLog has RBI entries | RBI stats display + save/reload persistence |
| `finished-game.json` | Completed game, FINAL banner shown | Game-over state regression tests |
| `legacy-teams-no-fingerprints.json` | Pre-v2 teams bundle (no player or team fingerprints) | Legacy import migration regression |

### Authoring a new fixture

Fixtures are signed JSON bundles (`RxdbExportedSave` format). The signature is a FNV-1a 32-bit checksum. **Always use Node.js (not Python)** to compute signatures — Python's `json.dumps` escapes non-ASCII characters differently from JS `JSON.stringify` (e.g. `·` → `\u00b7`), which causes sig mismatches at import time.

```js
const RXDB_EXPORT_KEY = "ballgame:rxdb:v1";

function fnv1a(str) {
  let h = 0x811c9dc5;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 1) {
    h ^= str.charCodeAt(i);
    h = Math.imul(h, 0x01000193) >>> 0;
  }
  return h.toString(16).padStart(8, "0");
}

function makeSig(header, events) {
  const inner = JSON.stringify({ header, events });
  return fnv1a(RXDB_EXPORT_KEY + inner);
}

const events = []; // empty for most fixtures; populate if your fixture needs recorded events
const payload = { version: 1, header, events, sig: makeSig(header, events) };
```

**Key fields in `header.stateSnapshot.state`:**

| Field | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pendingDecision` | Decision panel state | `null` = no panel; `{ kind: "defensive_shift" }` = shift panel; `{ kind: "pinch_hitter", candidates: [...], teamIdx: 0, lineupIdx: N }` = dropdown |
| `managerMode` (in `setup`) | Shows the DecisionPanel | Must be `true` for any pending-decision fixture |
| `managedTeam` (in `setup`) | Which team is managed | `0` = away, `1` = home |
| `playLog` | RBI / hit stats | Each entry needs `{ inning, half, batterNum, team, event, runs, rbi }` where `event` is the Hit enum value (Single=0, Double=1, Triple=2, Homerun=3, Walk=4) |
| `inningRuns` | Line-score display | `inningRuns[team][inning-1]` = runs that team scored in that inning |
| `lineupOrder` | Player IDs in batting order | Always populated for custom-team games |
| `playerOverrides` | Custom names/positions/stat mods | Use player IDs as keys |
| `resolvedMods` | Pre-computed stat mods | Needed for `pinch_hitter` candidates' `contactMod`/`powerMod` to be accurate |
| `rosterBench` | Bench player IDs | Required for `pinch_hitter` decisions to show candidates |

**Minimal fixture checklist:**

1. Build `header` object with `id`, `name`, `seed`, `homeTeamId`, `awayTeamId`, `schemaVersion: 1`, `setup`, and `stateSnapshot`
2. Start from `BASE_STATE` (all array/object fields present with safe defaults) and override only what you need
3. Compute `sig = makeSig(header, events)` using the Node.js snippet above (run via `node` in a scratch script)
4. Place file in `e2e/fixtures/<name>.json`
5. Use `await loadFixture(page, "<name>.json")` in the test

### State restoration mechanics

When `loadFixture` imports a save, `useSavesModal.ts` calls `handleLoad` which:
1. `dispatch({ type: "restore_game", payload: snap.state })` — applies `stateSnapshot.state` via `backfillRestoredState` (safe-defaults for any missing fields)
2. `onSetupRestore({ strategy, managedTeam, managerMode })` — writes to localStorage
3. `onLoadActivate(slot.id)` — sets `gameActive = true` so the DecisionPanel renders
4. Closes the modal

Because `pendingDecision` is part of `State` and `backfillRestoredState` merges `restored` over `fresh` defaults, a fixture that carries `pendingDecision: { kind: "defensive_shift" }` will render the manager decision panel instantly on load — no pitch needs to be thrown.

## Simulation Metrics Baseline (`e2e/tests/metrics-baseline.spec.ts`)

The metrics-baseline spec runs 100 full games via Instant mode (`SPEED_INSTANT=0`) and prints aggregate stats (BB%, K%, H/PA, runs/game) for before/after tuning comparisons. It is **excluded from the normal CI suite** and must be run manually.

### How to run

```bash
# Build first, then run only the metrics spec on desktop Chromium
yarn build
yarn test:e2e --project=desktop --grep "metrics-baseline"
```

### Canonical team fixture

All 100 games use the **5 teams committed to `e2e/fixtures/metrics-teams.json`**:
- Charlotte Bears (CHB)
- Denver Raiders (DRD)
- San Antonio Giants (SAG)
- Portland Foxes (PTF)
- Nashville Comets (NSC)

**This fixture is the single source of truth for all future passes.** Never recreate teams by clicking "Generate Random" across sessions — each run produces different random rosters, making cross-pass comparisons meaningless. Instead:
1. Import from the fixture file at the start of the spec (done automatically via `importTeamsFixture(page, "metrics-teams.json")`)
2. If teams must be regenerated: create 5 new teams, **Export All Teams** from the app, save the JSON over `e2e/fixtures/metrics-teams.json`, and commit **before** running any pass

> ⚠️ **Pass 1–3 used different teams (lost across sessions).** Pass 4 is the first pass using the committed `metrics-teams.json` fixture. All passes from pass 4 onward use the same rosters and are directly comparable.

### Starting the preview server for MCP browser automation

When running the metrics spec interactively via the Playwright MCP browser (not via `yarn test:e2e`), start the preview server as a **detached background process** on `0.0.0.0`:

```bash
# In bash (detach: true so it survives session shutdown)
cd /home/runner/work/self-playing-baseball/self-playing-baseball
npx vite preview --port 4173 --host 0.0.0.0 > /tmp/vitepreview.log 2>&1 &

# Verify it's up
ss -tlnp | grep 4173
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:4173
```

Then navigate the Playwright browser using **`http://127.0.0.1:4173`** (not `http://localhost:4173`):

```
// ✅ Works in the MCP Playwright browser
await page.goto("http://127.0.0.1:4173/exhibition/new");

// ❌ Fails with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in the MCP environment
await page.goto("http://localhost:4173/exhibition/new");
```

`localhost` does not resolve correctly in the MCP browser sandbox even though the server listens on `0.0.0.0`. Use `127.0.0.1` explicitly.
