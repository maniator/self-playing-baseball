## E2E Tests (`e2e/`)

Playwright E2E tests live in `e2e/` and are separate from the Vitest unit tests in `src/`.

### Projects

`playwright.config.ts` defines **7 projects**:

| Project | Browser | Viewport | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `determinism` | Desktop Chrome | 1280×800 | `determinism.spec.ts` only |
| `desktop` | Desktop Chrome | 1280×800 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `tablet` | WebKit (iPad gen 7) | 820×1180 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `iphone-15-pro-max` | WebKit (iPhone 15 Pro Max) | 430×739 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `iphone-15` | WebKit (iPhone 15) | 393×659 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `pixel-7` | Chromium (Pixel 7) | 412×839 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |
| `pixel-5` | Chromium (Pixel 5) | 393×727 | all except `determinism.spec.ts` |

The `determinism` project is intentionally isolated to desktop because it spawns two sequential fresh browser contexts per test — running it on all 6 device projects would multiply CI time by 6× for no additional coverage value (PRNG determinism is not viewport-dependent).

### Key design decisions

- **`vite preview` webServer** — E2E tests run against the production build (`dist/`), not `yarn dev`. This avoids the RxDB `RxDBDevModePlugin` dynamic import hanging the DB initialisation in headless Chromium.
- **Seeded games** — seeds are set via the seed input field in the New Game form, which calls `reinitSeed(seedStr)` on submit. The seed is not written to the URL. E2E tests use `configureNewGame(page, { seed: "..." })` to fill the input field.
- **`data-log-index` on log entries** — each play-by-play `<Log>` element has `data-log-index={log.length - 1 - arrayIndex}` (0 = oldest event). `captureGameSignature` reads indices 0–4 to get a stable deterministic signature regardless of how many new entries autoplay has prepended.
- **Fresh context per determinism run** — `browser.newContext()` gives each game run its own IndexedDB, preventing the auto-save from the first run from restoring mid-game state in the second run and breaking seed reproducibility.

### Helper functions (`e2e/utils/helpers.ts`)

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `resetAppState(page)` | Navigate to `/` and wait for DB loading to finish |
| `startGameViaPlayBall(page, options?)` | Navigate to `/exhibition/new`, fill seed-input field (if provided), configure teams, click Play Ball |
| `configureNewGame(page, options?)` | Fill seed/team fields on `/exhibition/new` without submitting |
| `loadFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Navigate to `/` → Load Saved Game → import file fixture → auto-load restores state — self-contained, no prior `resetAppState` needed |
| `waitForLogLines(page, count, timeout?)` | Expand log if collapsed, poll until ≥ count entries (default 60 s timeout) |
| `captureGameSignature(page, minLines?, logTimeout?)` | Wait for entries, read `data-log-index` 0–4, return joined string |
| `openSavesModal(page)` | Click saves button, wait for modal |
| `saveCurrentGame(page)` | Open modal + click Save current game |
| `loadFirstSave(page)` | Open modal + click first Load button, wait for modal to close |
| `importSaveFromFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Open modal + set file input to fixture path (requires active game) |
| `assertFieldAndLogVisible(page)` | Assert field-view + scoreboard visible with non-zero bounding boxes |
| `disableAnimations(page)` | Inject CSS to zero all animation/transition durations (use before visual snapshots) |
| `computeTeamsSignature(page, payload)` | Evaluate `fnv1a(TEAMS_EXPORT_KEY + JSON.stringify(payload))` in the browser page context |
| `importTeamsFixture(page, fixtureName)` | Navigate to `/teams`, set `import-teams-file-input` to fixture path, wait for `import-teams-success` |

### Visual snapshots

Committed baseline PNGs live in `e2e/tests/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/` named `<screen>-<project>-linux.png`. These baselines are rendered inside the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-noble` container (the same image used by `playwright-e2e.yml`), so they must **always** be regenerated inside that same container to guarantee pixel-identical rendering.

**Never run `yarn test:e2e:update-snapshots` locally and commit the result.** Local OS fonts and rendering differ from the CI container, causing false visual-diff failures on every subsequent CI run.

When an intentional UI change requires new baselines, you have two options:

**Option 1 — Use the `e2e-test-runner` agent (preferred for Copilot sessions):** The agent runs `--update-snapshots` inside the same Docker container and commits the updated PNGs directly to the branch in the same session. No workflow wait required. See `.github/agents/e2e-test-runner.md` for the exact `docker run` commands.

**Option 2 — Use the `update-visual-snapshots` GitHub Actions workflow:**
- It fires **automatically** on every push to any non-master branch.
- For manual control: **Actions → "Update Visual Snapshots" → Run workflow → select your branch → Run workflow**.
- The workflow runs inside the same Playwright container as CI, regenerates all snapshot PNGs, and commits them back to your branch (without `[skip ci]`), so `playwright-e2e.yml` runs against the updated baselines on that commit.

Do **not** regenerate snapshots unless you are intentionally changing a visual.

### Workflow sequencing for snapshot changes

When you push a commit that changes the app or its tests, **two things happen**:
1. `update-visual-snapshots` fires (auto-trigger), regenerates PNGs in the CI container, and commits them back to the branch.
2. `playwright-e2e` fires against the *original* commit — this run may fail if the new test has no baseline yet.

Once `update-visual-snapshots` commits the new baselines, a *second* `playwright-e2e` run is triggered against that commit. That run uses the fresh baselines and should pass. The initial failure on the original commit is expected and self-correcting.

### CI

`.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml` — pure test runner; does **not** regenerate or commit snapshots:
1. `yarn build` — produces `dist/` for `vite preview`
2. `npx playwright test` — runs all projects headlessly (browser binaries pre-installed in the container)
3. Uploads `playwright-report/` + `test-results/` as artifacts on failure

`.github/workflows/update-visual-snapshots.yml` — snapshot regeneration workflow (auto-triggers on every push to non-master branches):
- Runs inside the **same** `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-noble` container as `playwright-e2e.yml`.
- **Auto-trigger:** every push to any non-master branch.
- **Manual trigger:** Actions → "Update Visual Snapshots" → Run workflow → select branch.
- Commits updated PNGs back to the branch; the commit triggers `playwright-e2e` to validate them.
- Concurrency group: cancels stale queued runs when a newer push arrives.

## Save Fixtures for E2E Testing

Pre-crafted save files in `e2e/fixtures/` let E2E tests jump straight into a specific game situation without waiting for autoplay to reach it. This slashes test time from 90–150 s (waiting for decisions or scoring plays) to under 15 s.

### When to use a fixture instead of `startGameViaPlayBall`

| Situation | Use fixture? |
|---|---|
| Need a manager decision panel visible immediately | ✅ `pending-decision.json` |
| Need specific pending decision (pinch hitter, shift, etc.) | ✅ craft a new fixture |
| Need RBI / stats already on the board | ✅ `mid-game-with-rbi.json` |
| Testing visual snapshot of a mid-game UI element | ✅ craft a fixture for that state |
| Testing correctness of the simulation (seed regression, determinism) | ❌ must use real `startGameViaPlayBall` |
| Testing the full game-completion flow (FINAL banner) | ❌ must use real autoplay |

### The `loadFixture` helper

```typescript
import { loadFixture } from "../utils/helpers";

await loadFixture(page, "pending-decision.json");
// Game is now active with the fixture's stateSnapshot applied.
// No startGameViaPlayBall, no waitForLogLines, no long timeouts needed.
```

`loadFixture` navigates to **Home → "Load Saved Game" → `/saves` page**, imports the file through the saves page file input, waits for the auto-load to restore state and navigate to `/game`, and confirms the scoreboard is visible — all in one call.

### Available fixtures

| File | State summary | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `sample-save.json` | Inning 2, Mets vs Yankees, no pending decision | Import smoke tests |
| `pending-decision.json` | Inning 4 bottom, defensive_shift pending, managerMode on | Manager decision panel UI, notification smoke |
| `pending-decision-pinch-hitter.json` | Inning 7 top, pinch_hitter pending + 2 candidates, default teams | Pinch-hitter dropdown visual snapshot |
| `pending-decision-pinch-hitter-teams.json` | Same as above but with custom teams + player sigs in the bundle | Signed custom-team fixture with player fingerprints |
| `mid-game-with-rbi.json` | Inning 5 top, 3-2 score, playLog has RBI entries | RBI stats display + save/reload persistence |
| `finished-game.json` | Completed game, FINAL banner shown | Game-over state regression tests |
| `legacy-teams-no-fingerprints.json` | Pre-v2 teams bundle (no player or team fingerprints) | Legacy import migration regression |

### Authoring a new fixture

Fixtures are signed JSON bundles (`RxdbExportedSave` format). The signature is a FNV-1a 32-bit checksum. **Always use Node.js (not Python)** to compute signatures — Python's `json.dumps` escapes non-ASCII characters differently from JS `JSON.stringify` (e.g. `·` → `\u00b7`), which causes sig mismatches at import time.

```js
const RXDB_EXPORT_KEY = "ballgame:rxdb:v1";

function fnv1a(str) {
  let h = 0x811c9dc5;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 1) {
    h ^= str.charCodeAt(i);
    h = Math.imul(h, 0x01000193) >>> 0;
  }
  return h.toString(16).padStart(8, "0");
}

function makeSig(header, events) {
  const inner = JSON.stringify({ header, events });
  return fnv1a(RXDB_EXPORT_KEY + inner);
}

const events = []; // empty for most fixtures; populate if your fixture needs recorded events
const payload = { version: 1, header, events, sig: makeSig(header, events) };
```

**Key fields in `header.stateSnapshot.state`:**

| Field | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pendingDecision` | Decision panel state | `null` = no panel; `{ kind: "defensive_shift" }` = shift panel; `{ kind: "pinch_hitter", candidates: [...], teamIdx: 0, lineupIdx: N }` = dropdown |
| `managerMode` (in `setup`) | Shows the DecisionPanel | Must be `true` for any pending-decision fixture |
| `managedTeam` (in `setup`) | Which team is managed | `0` = away, `1` = home |
| `playLog` | RBI / hit stats | Each entry needs `{ inning, half, batterNum, team, event, runs, rbi }` where `event` is the Hit enum value (Single=0, Double=1, Triple=2, Homerun=3, Walk=4) |
| `inningRuns` | Line-score display | `inningRuns[team][inning-1]` = runs that team scored in that inning |
| `lineupOrder` | Player IDs in batting order | Always populated for custom-team games |
| `playerOverrides` | Custom names/positions/stat mods | Use player IDs as keys |
| `resolvedMods` | Pre-computed stat mods | Needed for `pinch_hitter` candidates' `contactMod`/`powerMod` to be accurate |
| `rosterBench` | Bench player IDs | Required for `pinch_hitter` decisions to show candidates |

**Minimal fixture checklist:**

1. Build `header` object with `id`, `name`, `seed`, `homeTeamId`, `awayTeamId`, `schemaVersion: 1`, `setup`, and `stateSnapshot`
2. Start from `BASE_STATE` (all array/object fields present with safe defaults) and override only what you need
3. Compute `sig = makeSig(header, events)` using the Node.js snippet above (run via `node` in a scratch script)
4. Place file in `e2e/fixtures/<name>.json`
5. Use `await loadFixture(page, "<name>.json")` in the test

### State restoration mechanics

When `loadFixture` imports a save, `useSavesModal.ts` calls `handleLoad` which:
1. `dispatch({ type: "restore_game", payload: snap.state })` — applies `stateSnapshot.state` via `backfillRestoredState` (safe-defaults for any missing fields)
2. `onSetupRestore({ strategy, managedTeam, managerMode })` — writes to localStorage
3. `onLoadActivate(slot.id)` — sets `gameActive = true` so the DecisionPanel renders
4. Closes the modal

Because `pendingDecision` is part of `State` and `backfillRestoredState` merges `restored` over `fresh` defaults, a fixture that carries `pendingDecision: { kind: "defensive_shift" }` will render the manager decision panel instantly on load — no pitch needs to be thrown.

## Simulation Metrics Baseline

There are **three complementary ways** to collect aggregate simulation metrics. The right choice depends on the context:

| Method | Speed | Sample size | Environment | Authoritative? | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vitest in-process harness | ~30 s | 100 games | Node.js only | ❌ Directional | Rapid iteration inside an agent session |
| **MCP browser (agent method)** | **~2 min** | **200+ games** | **Full Chrome + RxDB** | **✅ Ground truth** | **Agent-driven tuning rounds** |
| Playwright spec runner | ~20–25 min | 200 games | Full Chrome + RxDB | ✅ Ground truth | CI / human-driven full runs |

> **For agents (Copilot sessions): use the MCP browser batch-loop method.**
> The Playwright spec (`e2e/tests/metrics-baseline.spec.ts`) is a **reference implementation** that documents the full automated flow. For agent-driven tuning it is far faster to run games directly through the MCP browser using the single-tab batch-loop evaluate — you get results in real time, can interleave with code changes, and can collect 200 games in **under 2 minutes** of wall-clock time (vs ~20–25 minutes for the sequential spec runner).

### Canonical team fixture

All browser metric runs use the **5 teams committed to `e2e/fixtures/metrics-teams.json`**:
- Charlotte Bears (CHB)
- Denver Raiders (DRD)
- San Antonio Giants (SAG)
- Portland Foxes (PTF)
- Nashville Comets (NSC)

**This fixture is the single source of truth for all tuning passes.** Never recreate teams by clicking "Generate Random" — each run produces different random rosters, making cross-pass comparisons meaningless. The 10 canonical matchup combos are:

```
s1:  Charlotte Bears  @ Denver Raiders
s2:  Denver Raiders   @ Charlotte Bears
s3:  San Antonio Giants @ Portland Foxes
s4:  Portland Foxes   @ Nashville Comets
s5:  Nashville Comets @ San Antonio Giants
s6:  Charlotte Bears  @ San Antonio Giants
s7:  Denver Raiders   @ Portland Foxes
s8:  San Antonio Giants @ Nashville Comets
s9:  Portland Foxes   @ Charlotte Bears
s10: Nashville Comets @ Denver Raiders
```

Seeds are strings: `s1g1`, `s1g2`, … `s1g20` for matchup block s1 with 20 seeds (200 games total = 10 matchups × 20 seeds).

### Starting the preview server for MCP browser automation

The MCP browser (Chrome controlled by the `mcp-server-playwright` process) can **only** reach `localhost:5173` when the vite preview server is started by the **Playwright CLI's `webServer` config**, not when started manually from bash.

**What works — let Playwright own the server:**

```bash
# Build first (required — preview serves dist/)
yarn build

# Start the Playwright metrics test in the background.
# Its webServer config starts `npx vite preview --port 5173` as a child process,
# which is the only method that makes localhost:5173 reachable in the MCP browser.
cd /home/runner/work/self-playing-baseball/self-playing-baseball
npx playwright test --config=playwright-metrics.config.ts --project=desktop > /tmp/pltest.txt 2>&1 &

# Wait ~12 seconds for vite preview to boot, then verify
sleep 12 && ss -tlnp | grep 5173
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}" http://localhost:5173/
```

Once the server is up, navigate the MCP browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

**What does NOT work (manually started servers are unreachable from MCP Chrome):**

```bash
# ❌ All of these fail in the MCP browser with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED or ERR_FAILED:
npx vite preview --port 5173                    # binds [::1]:5173
npx vite preview --port 5173 --host 0.0.0.0    # binds 0.0.0.0:5173
npx vite preview --port 5173 --host 127.0.0.1  # binds 127.0.0.1:5173
npx vite preview --port 5173 --host ::1         # binds [::1]:5173
```

**Root cause:** The MCP browser (`mcp-server-playwright`) controls the Chrome process (PID visible via `pgrep -f "chrome.*playwright"`). When `npx playwright test` runs it connects to the same Chrome process and registers `localhost:5173` with Chrome's networking stack via the webServer handshake. A manually-started server never goes through that handshake, so Chrome's network service rejects connections to it regardless of bind address.

**Important:** The background Playwright test will eventually time out (60-minute timeout) and kill its vite preview server. If the server goes away mid-session, restart it with the same command above.

### Agent method: MCP browser with batch-loop evaluate (preferred for tuning rounds)

This is the **fastest way for an agent to collect 200+ browser game metrics**. In Instant mode, game simulation completes in essentially **zero wall-clock time** — a 9-inning game renders in <100ms on the active tab. The only real timing cost is MCP tool-call overhead (~2–3 seconds per `playwright-browser_*` call).

> **Key insight: use a single `evaluate` call that loops over many games.** A single `playwright-browser_evaluate` call can start a game, `await waitForFinal()`, collect stats, and immediately start the next game — all inside the JS context, with zero MCP round-trips between games. 10 games per tab = 1 evaluate call ≈ 2–3 seconds of wall-clock time. 200 games across 10 tabs = ~20 evaluate calls + ~10 tab-switch calls ≈ **under 2 minutes of total wall-clock time**.

> **Background tabs DO NOT advance.** Browsers throttle background-tab JS timers to a minimum of ~1000ms. In Instant mode, a game that completes in <100ms on the active tab takes several minutes frozen in a background tab. **Do not rely on background tabs finishing games while you are on another tab.** The batch-loop approach below handles this correctly by running all games for a tab sequentially within a single active-tab evaluate call.

#### One-time setup per session

1. Build the app and start the Playwright webServer (see above).
2. Navigate the MCP browser to `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Set localStorage for Instant mode + no-manager — **this applies to all tabs on the same origin**:
   ```js
   localStorage.setItem("speed", "0");              // SPEED_INSTANT
   localStorage.setItem("announcementVolume", "0"); // mute TTS
   localStorage.setItem("alertVolume", "0");        // mute alerts
   localStorage.setItem("_e2eNoInningPause", "1");  // skip half-inning pause
   localStorage.setItem("managerMode", "false");    // fully unmanaged
   ```
   > **Speed note:** There is no speed selector on the `/exhibition/new` form. Speed is read from `localStorage.speed` by the game when it starts. The `"speed": "0"` set here (SPEED_INSTANT) is shared across all same-origin tabs in Chromium — you only need to set it once. Do **not** try to inject a speed `<select>` on the new-game form; no such element exists. If you are unsure whether Instant mode is active, confirm via the game controls dropdown on any running game tab — it will show "Instant" selected.
4. Navigate to `/teams` and import `e2e/fixtures/metrics-teams.json` via the **Import from File** button. Teams persist in RxDB for the entire Chrome session — this only needs to be done once.
5. Clear any previous results and console error log:
   ```js
   localStorage.removeItem("metricsResults");
   localStorage.removeItem("metricsConsoleErrors");
   // Install a persistent console-error capture shim on the current page.
   // Re-run this after each navigation (it survives within a page context only).
   const _orig = { error: console.error, warn: console.warn };
   console.error = (...a) => { _orig.error(...a); const msgs = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsConsoleErrors')||'[]'); msgs.push('[E] '+a.join(' ')); localStorage.setItem('metricsConsoleErrors', JSON.stringify(msgs)); };
   console.warn  = (...a) => { _orig.warn(...a);  const msgs = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsConsoleErrors')||'[]'); msgs.push('[W] '+a.join(' ')); localStorage.setItem('metricsConsoleErrors', JSON.stringify(msgs)); };
   ```
   > **Note:** The shim captures errors from the current page context only. When you navigate between pages the shim is reset — reinstall it after each page load, or use `playwright-browser_console_messages` at the end to see all accumulated messages for the session.

  };
  const results = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsResults') || '[]');
  results.push(result);
  localStorage.setItem('metricsResults', JSON.stringify(results));
  return { count: results.length, lastResult: result };
})();
```

#### Combined collect + start next game (preferred — halves MCP tool-call count)

Instead of 4 tool calls per game (switch tab → collect evaluate → navigate → inject+start evaluate), use a single `playwright-browser_evaluate` that collects stats **and** clicks "New Game" then injects the next matchup — reducing to 2 calls per game (switch tab → combined evaluate):

```js
// After a game reaches FINAL, use this single evaluate to collect AND start the next game.
// This halves MCP tool-call overhead vs the separate collect → navigate → inject flow.
(async function(nextAway, nextHome, nextSeed) {
  const sleep = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));

  // ── Collect stats from completed game ─────────────────────────────────────
  const thisGame = document.querySelector('[data-testid="stats-tab-this-game"]');
  if (thisGame) { thisGame.click(); await sleep(150); }
  function readTable() {
    let ab = 0, h = 0, bb = 0, k = 0;
    for (const row of document.querySelectorAll('table tbody tr')) {
      if (row.closest('[data-testid="scoreboard"]')) continue;
      const cells = [...row.querySelectorAll('td')];
      if (cells.length < 6) continue;
      const n = i => { const t = cells[i]?.textContent?.trim(); return (t && t !== '–') ? parseInt(t, 10) || 0 : 0; };
      ab += n(2); h += n(3); bb += n(4); k += n(5);
    }
    return { ab, h, bb, k };
  }
  const tabs = document.querySelectorAll('[role="tab"]');
  tabs[0].click(); await sleep(200);
  const awayStats = readTable();
  tabs[1].click(); await sleep(200);
  const homeStats = readTable();
  const sb = document.querySelector('[data-testid="scoreboard"]');
  const hdrs = [...(sb?.querySelectorAll('thead tr th,thead tr td') || [])];
  const rIdx = hdrs.findIndex(c => c.textContent?.trim() === 'R');
  const scores = [...(sb?.querySelectorAll('tbody tr') || [])]
    .filter(r => r.querySelectorAll('td').length > 3).slice(0, 2)
    .map(row => { const cells = [...row.querySelectorAll('td')]; return rIdx >= 0 ? parseInt(cells[rIdx]?.textContent?.trim() || '0') || 0 : 0; });
  const result = { ab: awayStats.ab + homeStats.ab, h: awayStats.h + homeStats.h, bb: awayStats.bb + homeStats.bb, k: awayStats.k + homeStats.k, awayScore: scores[0] ?? 0, homeScore: scores[1] ?? 0 };
  const results = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsResults') || '[]');
  results.push(result);
  localStorage.setItem('metricsResults', JSON.stringify(results));

  // ── Navigate to new game form and start next game ─────────────────────────
  // "New Game" button appears after FINAL — click it to navigate (SPA push-state).
  const newGameBtn = document.querySelector('[data-testid="new-game-button"]');
  if (newGameBtn) {
    newGameBtn.click();
  } else {
    // Fallback: push state directly into React Router
    window.history.pushState({}, '', '/exhibition/new');
    window.dispatchEvent(new PopStateEvent('popstate'));
  }
  await sleep(500);
  // Wait for the form to be ready
  await new Promise(r => { const c = () => document.querySelector('[data-testid="new-game-custom-away-team-select"]') ? r() : setTimeout(c, 100); c(); });
  function setSelect(testId, label) {
    const el = document.querySelector(`[data-testid="${testId}"]`);
    const opt = [...el.options].find(o => o.text.includes(label));
    const ns = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLSelectElement.prototype, 'value').set;
    ns.call(el, opt.value); el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }));
  }
  function setSeed(val) {
    const el = document.querySelector('[data-testid="seed-input"]');
    const ns = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
    ns.call(el, val);
    const fk = Object.keys(el).find(k => k.startsWith('__reactFiber'));
    if (fk) el[fk]?.memoizedProps?.onChange?.({ target: el });
    else el.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
  }
  setSelect('new-game-custom-away-team-select', nextAway);
  setSelect('new-game-custom-home-team-select', nextHome);
  setSeed(nextSeed);
  await sleep(300);
  document.querySelector('[data-testid="play-ball-button"]').click();
  return { collected: result.awayScore + '-' + result.homeScore, started: `${nextAway} @ ${nextHome} ${nextSeed}`, total: results.length };
})('Charlotte Bears', 'Denver Raiders', 's1g2');
```

> **Why this works:** After FINAL the app shows a "New Game" button that navigates to `/exhibition/new` via React Router's SPA push-state (no full page reload). The evaluate continues executing in the same JavaScript context, so you can collect stats and start the next game within a single tool call. If the "New Game" button's `data-testid` is not found, the snippet falls back to `history.pushState`.

#### Reading aggregate results

After any number of games, evaluate this snippet to see running totals:

```js
const r = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsResults') || '[]');
const PA = r.reduce((s,g) => s+g.ab+g.bb, 0);
const BB = r.reduce((s,g) => s+g.bb, 0);
const K  = r.reduce((s,g) => s+g.k,  0);
const H  = r.reduce((s,g) => s+g.h,  0);
const runs = r.reduce((s,g) => s+g.awayScore+g.homeScore, 0);
`${r.length} games | BB%=${(BB/PA*100).toFixed(1)}% | K%=${(K/PA*100).toFixed(1)}% | H/PA=${(H / PA).toFixed(3)} | R/game=${(runs/r.length).toFixed(1)} | BB/game=${(BB/r.length).toFixed(1)}`;
```

#### Reading console errors and warnings

After a batch of games, use the **`playwright-browser_console_messages`** tool to retrieve all console messages accumulated since the browser session started. This is the most reliable way to see errors across page navigations.

For a quick summary filtered to actionable errors only (excludes known noise like the RxDB premium banner and blocked GTM):

```js
// Evaluate this on any page after the batch to see filtered errors
const KNOWN_NOISE = [
  'ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT',
  'RxDB Open Core RxStorage',
  'AudioContext',
  'useRxdbGameSync: failed to update progress',
];
const msgs = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('metricsConsoleErrors') || '[]');
const filtered = msgs.filter(m => !KNOWN_NOISE.some(n => m.includes(n)));
filtered.length
  ? filtered.slice(0, 20).join('\n')
  : 'No unexpected errors';
```

Common expected errors during Instant-mode batch runs:

| Error | Cause | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `useRxdbGameSync: failed to update progress (game over)` | Rapid navigation races RxDB write chain | None — cosmetic only |
| `useRxdbGameSync: failed to update progress (half-inning)` | Same as above | None — cosmetic only |
| `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` (GTM) | Ad-blocker in browser | None |
| RxDB premium upsell banner | Expected on every RxDB init | None |

If you see errors outside this table — especially React render errors, unhandled rejections, or `TypeError` — investigate before accepting the metrics.

#### Efficiency: single-tab batch loop (recommended approach)

**⚠️ Background tabs do NOT advance.** Browsers throttle background-tab JavaScript timers to a minimum of ~1000ms. In Instant mode, a game that completes in <100ms on the active tab would take several minutes frozen in a background tab. Do not rely on pipelining across tabs.

The recommended approach is the **single-tab batch-loop evaluate**: a single `playwright-browser_evaluate` call that loops over multiple games sequentially on the active tab. Simulation in Instant mode takes <100ms per game; the only overhead is the polling sleep calls inside the evaluate. 10 games complete inside a single evaluate call in ~2–3 seconds of wall-clock time.

```js
// Single batch-loop evaluate: runs N games on the current tab in one MCP call.
// ⬇ Edit these three values before calling:
const away = 'Charlotte Bears';  // away team name — must exactly match an imported team name
const home = 'Denver Raiders';   // home team name — valid names: Charlotte Bears, Denver Raiders, San Antonio Giants, Portland Foxes, Nashville Comets
const prefix = 's1';                       // seed prefix, e.g. 's1' → s1g1, s1g2, …
(async () => {
  const sleep = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));

**Quick smoke check (100 games, ~50–60 s):** Open 10 tabs, run the snippet above on each (10 games/tab × 10 tabs = 100 games). Useful for direction-checking, not for policy-compliant tuning rounds.

**Minimum tuning round (200 games, ~90–120 s):** Change `g<=10` to `g<=20` in the loop above to collect 20 games per tab. Run across 10 tabs for 200 games total. **200 games is the minimum required before drawing any tuning conclusions.**

**Workflow (applies to both):**
1. Open 10 browser tabs (one per matchup block) — they only need to be on any valid app page.
2. On each tab, run the batch-loop evaluate with the appropriate `away`, `home`, and `prefix` for that matchup block.
3. After all tabs complete, collect aggregate results with the summary snippet below.

**Timing breakdown (verified from actual 108-game run on 2026-03-09):**
- Simulation time per game: **<100ms** (essentially zero in Instant mode on active tab)
- Time per batch-loop evaluate (10 games): **~2–3 seconds** (MCP tool-call overhead only)
- Tab-switch calls: **~2 seconds each**
- Total for 100 games (10 tabs × 10 games): **~10 evaluate calls + 10 tab-switch calls ≈ 50–60 seconds**
- Total for 200 games (10 tabs × 20 games): **~20 evaluate calls + 10 tab-switch calls ≈ 90–120 seconds**

The game simulation in Instant mode is never the bottleneck. The only overhead is MCP tool-call round-trips.

### Playwright spec runner: reference implementation for automated runs

`e2e/tests/metrics-baseline.spec.ts` is the **canonical automated implementation** of the above MCP workflow. It is:
- A faithful, self-contained reference showing exactly what a correct 200-game metrics run looks like
- Useful for running metrics in CI or in a human terminal session without MCP
- Configured via `playwright-metrics.config.ts` (60-minute timeout, desktop Chromium)
- **Captures all console errors and warnings** via a `page.on('console', ...)` listener and prints a filtered summary (excluding known noise) after the metrics box
- **Not the fastest option for agent sessions** — it runs games sequentially (one at a time), taking ~20–25 minutes for 200 games. The single-tab batch-loop approach above can collect 200 games in under 2 minutes of wall-clock time via MCP.

```bash
# Build first, then run the spec
yarn build
npx playwright test --config=playwright-metrics.config.ts --project=desktop
```

The spec runs `GAMES_PER_BLOCK` games per matchup block. `GAMES_PER_BLOCK = 20` gives 200 games (the minimum per tuning-round policy). Change it to `30` for a 300-game final validation run.

### Vitest in-process harness vs browser run

The project has three ways to measure simulation metrics at scale:

| | Stock-team harness | Custom-team harness | Browser run (MCP or spec) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File** | `src/test/calibration/simHarness.test.ts` | `src/test/calibration/customTeamMetrics.test.ts` | MCP browser / `metrics-baseline.spec.ts` |
| **Speed** | ~5 s | ~30 s | ~2 min (MCP batch-loop) / ~20–25 min (spec) |
| **Teams** | All-balanced stock players | `metrics-teams.json` fixture | `metrics-teams.json` fixture |
| **Environment** | Node.js only | Node.js only | Full Chrome + RxDB + React |
| **RNG sequence** | Pure game logic | Pure game logic | Extra `random()` calls from React, RxDB, audio, TTS |
| **Authoritative?** | ❌ Directional only | ❌ Directional only | ✅ Ground truth |
| **Use for** | Fastest iteration signal | Better fixture match | Required final validation |

**Key rule:** Never claim a tuning success based solely on the in-process harness. The harness provides a fast directional signal (seconds), but the browser run is the only valid apple-to-apple comparison against prior browser baselines. The harness BB% is typically **~1–2 pp lower** than browser BB% due to PRNG sequence differences.

If the harness and browser results move in opposite directions, the browser result is correct.
