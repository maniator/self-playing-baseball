    # The official Playwright container image ships all required OS/system
    # dependencies, fonts, and browser binaries pre-installed at /ms-playwright
    # (PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH is set in the image). No browser installation or
    # system deps steps are needed — the container is the complete, consistent
    # environment for both CI and Copilot sessions.
